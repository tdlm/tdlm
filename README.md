# Hi, I'm Scott :wave:

I am a Full Stack Engineer working remotely from 🍊range County, California. Primarily, I work with React and WordPress. I really love working with Next.js, Tailwind and utilizing TypeScript wherever possible to ensure type safety.

I have a [site](https://tdlm.github.io/) that goes into more detail about who I am, what I do and how to contact me but for now, just know that I love:

- 👪 My family and our 🐶 dog
- 🔨 Building great things
- ✨ Quality, easy-to-understand code ✨
- 😆 Good humor and jokes
- 🛰️ Being fully remote

P.S. If you're curious, you can read about [how I work](https://gist.github.com/tdlm/3cb67429e01212f921aace4e1af100a6).
